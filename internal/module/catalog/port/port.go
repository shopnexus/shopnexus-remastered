// Package port: the interface the catalog adapter must satisfy.
//
// It speaks in raw int64 keys and domain entities — opaque ids stop at the api boundary.
// Methods are added one slice at a time; the dictionaries come first because a listing
// cannot reference a category that has no way of existing.
