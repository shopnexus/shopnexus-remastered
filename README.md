## Epic features
### 1. Have two mode: modular monolith and microservices
- Modular monolith: all services in one process -> everything is easy ðŸ¤‘
- Microservices: each service run its own process -> scaling and independent deployment, but hell for debugging ðŸ¥€


## My code, my rules...

### Database
- Always use table per type (TPT) in database design
- Audit snapshot for tax authority and transaction dispute purpose
- SearchEngine(search_sync): Query event table to get the latest 


### Go
- Folder structure: Vertical slice (by service)

#### General
- No use orchestration patterns, use choreography instead.
- Use choreography pattern with compensating transactions to handle failures gracefully.
- Always use events to communicate between services to microservice friendly and avoid tight coupling.

#### Early stage:
- Use models generated from sqlc as much as possible to coupling data with database schema, easy for development
- Only create custom model for DTOs only (response data) and some custom types that are not directly related to database schema

#### Later stage:
- Create our own domain models to decouple from database schema


### Biz
- Tag only for SEO purpose, use category for product grouping instead.
- Handle the problem "Slowly Changing Dimension (SCD)" in database design (financial transactions related)
- Always use the sharedmodel.Currency to handle money related fields
- Use validator/v10 to validate the DTO from client side

### Ack
"Interface values are comparable. Two interface values are equal if they have identical dynamic types and equal dynamic values or if both have value nil."
- Which means when compare an interface value with nil, it will always return false because the "nil" is untyped nil, not typed (as the interface) nil.
